#### Calcium imaging signal processing and network analysis

*   **Image Analysis**:
     *   **Calcium Imaging Data Processing**: Although "Suite2p" (a Python package) was used for initial processing of Ca2+ imaging data to identify neurons and regions of interest (ROIs), the subsequent calculation of **correlation matrices** using Pearson's pairwise correlation was performed in MATLAB. This MATLAB code could also be part of the GitHub repository.
